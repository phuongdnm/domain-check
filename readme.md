# Domain check

-   Since I works with servers almost everyday, I usually have to set up new server (ip, domain, subdomain, ...).
-   This script help me to figure out whether the server is up or the domain is being served correctly or not.

## Steps:

-   Install Docker/Docker-Compose by copy + paste: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
-   Run

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

-   Access ipv4, then check your domain/subdomain
